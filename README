This is a sample application for Android, showing access to RTS2 values.

Intend is to extend this with the full personalization through Preferences, etc.

To compile:

mvn clean install android:redeploy

To run some tests:

mvn test

You will need Maven (sudo apt-get install maven) and Android SDK with Default emulator host (or add new using android avd).
